# My First XSS: Breaking JavaScript Like LEGO

## The Beginning of My Bug Hunting Journey

It was a regular Tuesday in the computer lab when everything changed. I was working on a basic web form assignment when I accidentally typed some HTML in an input field. Instead of seeing my text, I saw... well, rendered HTML.

## The "Aha!" Moment

\`\`\`javascript
<script>alert('Hello World!')</script>
\`\`\`

That simple payload opened my eyes to the world of web vulnerabilities. Here's what I learned:

### Key Lessons:
- Always test input validation
- Understanding how browsers parse HTML/JS
- The importance of sanitization
- Context matters in XSS attacks

## My First Real Discovery

After weeks of practice, I found my first real XSS in a university portal:

\`\`\`html
<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS by Raman')">
\`\`\`

The feeling was incredible! But more importantly, I learned about responsible disclosure.

## Tools That Helped Me

1. **Burp Suite** - For intercepting requests
2. **Browser Dev Tools** - Understanding DOM manipulation
3. **XSS Hunter** - For blind XSS detection
4. **OWASP ZAP** - Free alternative scanner

## What's Next?

This was just the beginning. My journey into cybersecurity had officially started, one vulnerability at a time.

*Remember: Always hack ethically and with permission!*

# Recon Like a Ninja: OSINT for Pentesters

## The Art of Digital Reconnaissance

Information gathering is 70% of successful penetration testing. Here's how I approach OSINT like a digital ninja.

## My Recon Methodology

### Phase 1: Passive Information Gathering
\`\`\`bash
# Subdomain enumeration
subfinder -d target.com -silent | httpx -silent
amass enum -passive -d target.com
\`\`\`

### Phase 2: Google Dorking
Some of my favorite dorks:
- \`site:target.com filetype:pdf\`
- \`inurl:admin site:target.com\`
- \`"database error" site:target.com\`

### Phase 3: Social Media Intelligence
- LinkedIn for employee information
- GitHub for leaked credentials
- Twitter for company announcements

## Essential Tools

1. **Subfinder** - Fast subdomain discovery
2. **Amass** - Comprehensive asset discovery
3. **theHarvester** - Email and subdomain gathering
4. **Shodan** - Internet-connected device search
5. **Wayback Machine** - Historical website data

## Pro Tips

- Always document everything
- Use multiple sources to verify information
- Respect rate limits and robots.txt
- Stay within legal boundaries

## Coming Up in Part 2

Next week I'll cover active reconnaissance techniques and how to chain tools for maximum efficiency.

*Stay tuned for more recon techniques!*

# WAF Evasion: Dancing Around Digital Firewalls

## Understanding Web Application Firewalls

WAFs are like digital bouncers - they check every request before letting it through. But like any bouncer, they have blind spots.

## Common WAF Bypass Techniques

### 1. Encoding Variations
\`\`\`javascript
// URL Encoding
%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

// HTML Entity Encoding
&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;

// Unicode Encoding
\u003cscript\u003ealert(1)\u003c/script\u003e
\`\`\`

### 2. Case Manipulation
\`\`\`html
<ScRiPt>alert(1)</ScRiPt>
<SCRIPT>alert(1)</SCRIPT>
\`\`\`

### 3. Comment Insertion
\`\`\`html
<script/*comment*/>alert(1)</script>
<script>/*comment*/alert(1)</script>
\`\`\`

## Advanced Techniques

### SQL Injection WAF Bypass
\`\`\`sql
# Using comments
SELECT/*comment*/password/*comment*/FROM/*comment*/users

# Using concatenation
SELECT CONCAT('pa','ss','word') FROM users

# Using alternative syntax
SELECT password FROM users WHERE id=1e0
\`\`\`

## Tools for WAF Testing

1. **WAFNinja** - Automated WAF bypass
2. **SQLMap** - With tamper scripts
3. **Burp Suite** - Manual testing
4. **Custom Python Scripts** - For specific cases

## Real-World Example

I once encountered a WAF that blocked "script" but not "Script":
\`\`\`html
<Script>alert('Bypassed!')</Script>
\`\`\`

Simple, but effective!

## Ethical Considerations

- Only test on systems you own or have permission to test
- Report findings responsibly
- Help improve security, don't exploit it

*Remember: With great power comes great responsibility!*

# Cybersecurity Memes That Hit Different

## The Therapy We Didn't Know We Needed

Let's be honest - cybersecurity can be stressful. Sometimes you need a good laugh to keep your sanity intact. Here are the memes that perfectly capture our daily struggles.

## The Password Struggle is Real

### "Your password must contain..."
- At least 8 characters
- One uppercase letter
- One number
- One special character
- The blood of your enemies
- A haiku about your childhood trauma

*We've all been there!*

## SQL Injection Classics

\`\`\`sql
-- Little Bobby Tables strikes again
'; DROP TABLE students; --
\`\`\`

The eternal XKCD reference that never gets old. If you don't know this one, you're not a real developer!

## The Bug Bounty Life

### Expectations vs Reality

**Expectation**: "I'll find a critical RCE and get $10,000!"

**Reality**: "Duplicate... duplicate... informational... not applicable..."

*The pain is real, fellow bug hunters.*

## IT Support Nightmares

**User**: "The internet is down!"
**IT**: "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
**User**: "Yes, I restarted Internet Explorer."

*Based on a true story (probably)*

## Penetration Testing Humor

### Client Expectations
- "Can you hack into their mainframe?"
- "It should only take a few minutes, right?"
- "Just like in the movies!"

### Reality
- Spending 3 hours on subdomain enumeration
- Finding OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Writing a 50-page report

## The Home Lab Chronicles

**Stage 1**: "I'll just set up a simple lab"
**Stage 2**: *Buys 5 Raspberry Pis*
**Stage 3**: *Entire room becomes a data center*
**Stage 4**: *Electricity bill arrives*
**Stage 5**: "Maybe the cloud isn't so bad..."

## Conference Season

### DEF CON Bingo
- Someone mentions "social engineering"
- WiFi network named "FREE_MALWARE"
- Guy with 20 badges on his lanyard
- "This year's CTF was easier"
- Lock picking village is packed

## The Certification Journey

**Step 1**: "I'll get my CISSP"
**Step 2**: *Reads study guide*
**Step 3**: "What is risk management?"
**Step 4**: *Existential crisis*
**Step 5**: "Maybe I'll start with Security+"

## Incident Response Reality

**8 AM**: Minor security alert
**9 AM**: "It's probably nothing"
**10 AM**: "We might have a problem"
**11 AM**: "WHERE'S THE INCIDENT COMMANDER?"
**12 PM**: *CEO asks if we're still a company*

## The Vulnerability Disclosure Dilemma

**You**: "I found a critical vulnerability"
**Company**: "Thanks! Here's a $5 gift card"
**Black market**: "We'll give you $50,000"
**Your conscience**: "Choose wisely..."
**You**: *Takes the gift card like a boss*

## Finally, The Universal Truth

**Management**: "We need 100% security!"
**Security Team**: "We need 100% budget!"
**Reality**: *Uses free trial of antivirus*

## Bonus: Developer vs Security

**Developer**: "It works on my machine"
**Security**: "Your machine is compromised"
**Developer**: "..."
**Security**: "..."
**Both**: *Awkward silence*

---

*Remember: If you can't laugh at cybersecurity, you'll cry. And crying shorts out keyboards.*
